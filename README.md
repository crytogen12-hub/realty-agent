Lean, no-code blueprint for a **global investor acquisition system** that feeds qualified Dubai commercial-property leads to a licensed brokerage partner.

## Recommended initial focus

For a $2,000 starting budget, the strongest first niche is:

- **UK/Europe property investors** seeking Dubai commercial opportunities.

This segment is easier to reach with LinkedIn + Apollo, aligns with the partner footprint (UK/Switzerland/Dubai), and gives cleaner messaging than broad multi-audience campaigns.
