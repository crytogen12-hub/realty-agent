   - Pull trend signals and combine with content pillars
   - Generate 3 daily angles: educational, aspirational, authority

2. **Script + Hook Engine**
   - Produce a 3-second pattern-interrupt hook
   - Include retention triggers, cut cadence, and CTA

3. **Video Rendering Pipeline**
   - Face brand: recorded clips + AI-assisted editing/voice/captions
   - Faceless brand: premium b-roll + motion graphics + captions

4. **Auto-Posting Engine**
   - Queue to YouTube, Instagram, TikTok APIs
   - Apply staggered publish windows and per-platform formatting

5. **Performance Optimization Loop**
   - Track watch time, retention, saves, shares, follows, clicks
   - Auto-adjust hook style, pacing, duration, CTA angle weekly

## 90-Day Growth Sequence

- **Month 1:** 2-3 short-form posts daily (volume + feedback loop)
- **Month 2:** Attach lead magnets and service offers
- **Month 3:** Launch paid consulting/implementation offers

---

## Recommendation: Choose **4) Hybrid**

Use a hybrid model:

- **Primary:** High-end faceless + AI clone voice for scale consistency
- **Secondary:** Personal on-camera clips 1-2x weekly for trust and authority

### Why Hybrid Wins

- Preserves personal credibility (critical for higher-ticket monetization)
- Keeps posting volume high without daily filming bottlenecks
- Enables fast testing of hooks/angles while maintaining brand identity
- Future-proofs the brand for both personal and media-company formats

## Practical Posting Split

- 70% faceless or AI-voice authority content
- 30% personal face-led perspective clips

This creates a recognizable identity while staying operationally scalable.
